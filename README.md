# Timed Greeting
## Instructions

Define four functions, `greeting`, `isMorning`, `isAfternoon`, `isNight`.

`greeting` should accept the current hour.
The `greeting` function should pass the hour right now to
the other three functions and based on their `true`/`false`
response, should give the appropriate greeting for the time
of day.

morning: 06 - 11: Good Morning!
afternoon: 12 - 19: Good Afternoon!
night: 20 - 05: Good Night!

Note we're using military time.

**Note**

You will be requiring and calling the helper functions, like `isMorning`, `isAfternoon` and `isNight` within `greeting`, so pass those specs first.
